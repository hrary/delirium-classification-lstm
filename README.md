This is an algorithm meant to try and classify vitals readings as Hospital Induced Delirium (HID) or not 
based on live data from a wearable device.

It makes use of an LSTM algorithm in PyTorch.

Due to patient privacy laws, the datasets are likely not very accurate nor very big, however, one could easily further train this model with an appropriate dataset
